Description: Placental epigenetic clock to estimate aging based on gestational age using DNA methylation levels, so called placental epigenetic clock (PlEC). We developed a PlEC for the 2024 Placental Clock DREAM Challenge (<https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn59520082/wiki/628063>). Our PlEC achieved the top performance based on an independent test set. PlEC can be used to identify accelerated/decelerated aging of placenta for understanding placental dysfunction-related conditions, e.g., great obstetrical syndromes including preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, preterm labor, preterm premature rupture of the membranes, late spontaneous abortion, and placental abruption. Detailed methodologies and examples are documented in our vignette, available at <https://herdiantrisufriyana.github.io/rplec/doc/placental_aging_analysis.html>.
